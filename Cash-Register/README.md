# Cash-Register

I coded this because we did something pretty similar in school with excel and i thought that a python program would work much better than a excel file xD

Commands :
- 1 = add "Pommes" with 1€ to the shopping list
- 2 = add "Bratwurst with 2€ to the shopping list
- 3 = add Cola with 3€ to the shopping list
- exit = exit the terminal and see what you ordered and how much you need to pay
